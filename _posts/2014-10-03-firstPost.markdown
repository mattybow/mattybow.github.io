Testing 123.

Awesome, this kind of works.  This is my first blog post, hopefully one of many.  In the coming months I'll be posting my experiments, trials, failures, and frustrations with using various front end technologies.  This is record of the things that I'm interested in.  I'm hoping that this will also serve as a platform for me to find others that are interested in similar things.

Well, this has been pretty boring, so I'm just going to spice this up with some [`x-gifs`][xgifs] using [`flexbox`][flexbox] <--hawt.
